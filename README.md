# COVID-19 Classification Project

This repository contains the classification model and a WebApp framework using django. 

The model is trained on thousands of X-Ray image files of five classes (Normal/Covid/Bacterial Pneumonia/Viral Pneumonia/Tuberculosis).
The notebook also contains the evaluations of the model in confusion metrix and ROC curve. 

The Webapp can be run with django, and it will take in rgb files to output its predictions.
